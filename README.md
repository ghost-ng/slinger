# Slinger

Slinger is a versatile tool designed for advanced network interactions and manipulations, with a focus on the SMB protocol. It offers a range of functionalities for interacting with remote systems, including managing scheduled tasks, handling Windows Registry operations, and gathering system information.  Slinger is built on the impacket framework and should offer a similar feel to impacket functions.

## Features

- **Extensible Plugin System**: Easily extend Slinger's functionality with custom plugins.
- **Network Interaction**: Facilitates various SMB-based operations and DCE/RPC transport setup.
- **Task Scheduling**: Manage task scheduling such as creating, deleting, and running.
- **Registry Management**: Manage registry operations such as querying keys, subkeys, and values, deleting, and much more!
- **Service Control**: Manage windows services through create, delete, and run functions
- **System Information Gathering**: Gather detailed system information, including server disk information, logged-on users, and transport details.
- **Wrapper Commands**: Commands to edit port forwarding rules and view the windows firewalls
- **CLI System**: Slinger offers an exhaustively simple CLI complete with help entries

### Creating Your Own Plugin for Slinger

Contributions to the Slinger project, particularly in the form of plugins, are highly appreciated. If you're interested in developing a plugin, here's a guide to help you get started:

#### 1. Set Up Your Development Environment

- Fork the [Slinger repository](https://github.com/ghost-ng/slinger) and clone it to your local machine.
- Set up a Python development environment and install any necessary dependencies.

#### 2. Create a New Plugin

- Go to the `slinger/plugins` directory in your local repository.
- Create a new Python file for your plugin, e.g., `my_plugin.py`.
- Begin by importing the required modules, including the base plugin class:

  ```python
  from slinger.lib.plugin_base import PluginBase
  ```

#### 3. Develop Your Plugin

- Your plugin class should inherit from `PluginBase`.
- Implement the `get_parser` method to define the command-line interface for your plugin:

  ```python
  class MyPlugin(PluginBase):   <--required
      def get_parser(self):   <--required
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(add_help=False)   <--required
        subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')   <--required
        plugincmd_parser = subparsers.add_parser("plugincmd", help="My plugin subparser")   <--required
        plugincmd_parser.add_argument("--plugincmd", help="My plugin argument")
        plugincmd_parser.set_defaults(func=self.run)   <--required
        return parser   <--required
  ```

- The `run` method can be used as an entry point for your plugin's functionality. It should be defined to handle the plugin's core logic.  Whatever the function name, it should be the same name as that function you added in the parser's "set_defaults" and it should accept "args" as a function parameter.

  ```python
  def run(self, args):
      # Your plugin's core functionality goes here
  ```

- Add any additional methods or attributes necessary for your plugin.
- **View the example plugin for additional help**

#### 4. Test Your Plugin

- Place your plugin in the ~/.slinger/plugin directory Thoroughly test your plugin to ensure it functions correctly and integrates seamlessly with Slinger.
- Ensure your plugin adheres to the coding standards and conventions of the project.

#### 5. Document Your Plugin

- Provide clear documentation for your plugin, detailing its purpose, usage, and any other important information.
- Update the `README.md` or other relevant documentation to include your plugin's details.

#### 6. Submit a Pull Request

- Once your plugin is complete and tested, push your changes to your fork and create a pull request to the main Slinger repository.
- Describe your plugin's functionality and any other pertinent details in your pull request.

### General Guidelines

- Write clean, well-documented code that follows the project's style guidelines.
- If applicable, write tests for your code.
- Keep pull requests focused â€“ one feature or fix per request is ideal.
