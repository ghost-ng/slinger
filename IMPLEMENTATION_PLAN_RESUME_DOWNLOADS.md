# Implementation Plan: Resume Downloads Feature

## Executive Summary

**Nominated Next Research Task**: Resume Downloads Functionality  
**Priority**: High | **Complexity**: Medium | **Development Time**: 2-3 weeks  
**Risk Level**: Low (Defensive feature improving reliability)

## Rationale for Selection

### Why Resume Downloads?
1. **High User Impact**: Large file transfers often fail due to network issues
2. **Production Ready**: No security concerns - purely defensive enhancement
3. **Technical Foundation**: Builds on existing download infrastructure
4. **Real-World Need**: Essential for reliable file operations in unstable network environments
5. **HTB Testing Ready**: Can be validated against the same test environment

### Strategic Benefits
- **Reliability**: Dramatically improves success rate for large file transfers
- **User Experience**: Eliminates frustration from failed downloads
- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Avoids re-downloading already transferred portions
- **Professional Polish**: Brings slinger to enterprise-grade reliability standards

## Technical Research Analysis

### Current State Assessment
From codebase analysis of `src/slingerpkg/lib/smblib.py`:

#### Existing Download Infrastructure
```python
def download(self, remote_path, local_path, echo=True):
    # Current implementation - single-shot download
    # Uses self.conn.getFile() - atomic operation
    # No resume capability or error recovery
```

#### Key Findings
1. **Single-threaded transfers**: Current downloads are atomic operations
2. **No state persistence**: Transfer progress is not saved
3. **No error recovery**: Failed downloads restart from beginning  
4. **Binary mode**: Existing code uses proper binary file handling
5. **Path validation**: Robust path security already implemented

### SMB Protocol Capabilities

#### SMB Byte Range Requests
- **SMB2/3 Support**: Modern SMB versions support byte-range operations
- **ReadAndX Command**: Allows specifying offset and length for partial reads
- **Impacket Support**: Library provides necessary primitives for byte operations

#### Technical Challenges
1. **State Management**: Need to track download progress persistently
2. **File Integrity**: Ensure partial downloads maintain data integrity
3. **Error Detection**: Distinguish between recoverable and fatal errors
4. **Resume Logic**: Determine where to restart interrupted transfers

## Implementation Strategy

2. **State Management Design**
   - Design `.slinger-resume` file format for progress tracking
   - Plan atomic state updates to prevent corruption
   - Research file locking mechanisms for concurrent safety
   - Design cleanup procedures for completed/failed downloads

3. **Error Recovery Strategy**
   - Categorize SMB errors (recoverable vs fatal)
   - Design exponential backoff for network errors
   - Plan retry limits and timeout handling
   - Research connection recovery after network interruption

#### Deliverables:

       # Check for existing partial download
       # Implement chunked transfer with progress tracking
       # Save state after each successful chunk
       # Handle network errors with retry logic
   ```

2. **State Management System**
   ```python
   class DownloadState:
       def __init__(self, remote_path, local_path, total_size):
           self.remote_path = remote_path
           self.local_path = local_path  
           self.total_size = total_size
           self.bytes_downloaded = 0
           self.chunk_size = 64*1024
           self.checksum = None
           
       def save_state(self):
           # Atomic state file updates
           
       def load_state(self):
           # Resume from existing state file
   ```

3. **Integrity Verification**
   - Implement MD5/SHA256 checksum calculation
