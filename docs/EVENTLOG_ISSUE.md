# EventLog Implementation Issue

## Test Results Summary

### Working Features ✅
1. **No bind issues** - Multiple list commands work without rebinding problems
2. **Verbose formatting** - Output displays correctly without literal `\n` characters
3. **Connection stability** - No timeouts or transport errors
4. **Basic functionality** - Can connect, list logs, and query events

### Known Issues ❌
1. **Log separation failure** - All logs (Application, Security, System) return identical events
2. **No authentication events** - Security log doesn't show login events (4624, 4625, 4648, 4776)
3. **Same event repeated** - All queries return Event ID 1001 from Windows Error Reporting

## Problem Description

When querying different event logs (Application, Security, System) using the EventLog module, all logs return identical events:
- Record Number: 2405
- Event ID: 1001  
- Source: Windows Error Reporting

This occurs regardless of which log is queried.

## Technical Details

The implementation uses:
- Impacket's `even.py` module (legacy EventLog RPC interface)
- RPC UUID: 82273FDC-E32A-18C3-3F78-827929DC23EA
- Named pipe: \\pipe\\eventlog

## Possible Causes

1. **Legacy Interface Limitations**: The legacy EventLog RPC interface (`even.py`) may not properly distinguish between different logs on newer Windows systems (Windows Server 2016+).

2. **Server-Side Caching**: The Windows server might be returning cached or default event data regardless of the requested log.

3. **Parameter Issues**: Although we're passing the correct log names ("Application", "Security", "System") to `hElfrOpenELW`, the server might not be honoring them.

## Potential Solutions

1. **Use EventLog6 Interface**: Migrate to the newer `even6.py` interface which uses:
   - RPC UUID: F6BEAFF7-1E19-4FBB-9F8F-B89E2018337C
   - Different function calls (hEvtRpcOpenLogHandle, hEvtRpcQueryNext)
   - Better support for modern Windows systems

2. **Verify Log Names**: Some systems might expect different log name formats or paths.

3. **Alternative Approaches**: Consider using WMI or other Windows APIs for event log access on modern systems.

## Current Workaround

The EventLog functionality is working in terms of:
- Successfully connecting to the EventLog service
- Reading and parsing event records
- Proper output formatting

However, log separation is not functioning correctly, resulting in all logs showing the same events.
